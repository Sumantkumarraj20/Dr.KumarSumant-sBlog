### Summary

Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory condition of the pilosebaceous unit. It commonly affects the face, chest, back and shoulders and presents as comedones, papules, pustules, nodules and sometimes scarring. Management is severity-directed and aims for disease control.

### Epidemiology

- Very common worldwide; onset typically in adolescence and often improves in adulthood.

### Etiology & risk factors

- Multifactorial: increased sebum production, follicular hyperkeratosis, Cutibacterium acnes-driven inflammation, hormonal influences and genetic predisposition.

### Clinical features

- Noninflammatory lesions: open/closed comedones
- Inflammatory lesions: papules, pustules, nodules
- Severity ranges from mild comedonal disease to nodulocystic acne with scarring

### Diagnosis

- Primarily clinical. Investigations only when underlying causes (e.g., endocrine) are suspected.

### Differential diagnosis

- Consider rosacea, hidradenitis suppurativa, gram-negative folliculitis, pityrosporum folliculitis.

### Treatment flow

- Mild: topical therapy (retinoid, benzoyl peroxide)
- Moderate: topical combinations Â± oral antibiotics
- Severe: oral isotretinoin or specialist management

### Topical pharmacotherapy

- Retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics (use combinations to reduce resistance)

### Oral antibiotic therapy

- Limited-duration tetracyclines are commonly used for moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne; always combine with topical agents.

### Hormonal therapy

- Consider in females with signs of hyperandrogenism (COCs, spironolactone).

### Isotretinoin therapy

- Reserved for severe or refractory disease; requires monitoring and pregnancy prevention measures.

### Maintenance

- Long-term topical retinoid therapy often needed to prevent relapse.

### Special populations

- Pregnancy: avoid retinoids and tetracyclines; use pregnancy-safe alternatives.
