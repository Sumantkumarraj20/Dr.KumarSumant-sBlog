# Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder with altered motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and mucosal permeability. Diagnosis is clinical using Rome IV criteria, and management focuses on symptom control.

## Epidemiology

- Prevalence: 10–20% in North America and Europe; 20–50% of gastroenterology referrals.
- Sex: Women 1.5–2× more affected.
- Age: 20–39 years highest prevalence.
- Associated conditions: Fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, anxiety, GERD, functional dyspepsia.

## Pathophysiology

- IBS is a functional disorder with no single organic cause.
- Key mechanisms: altered GI motility, visceral hypersensitivity, mucosal barrier changes, psychosocial contributors.

## Clinical features

- Abdominal pain: chronic, often relieved by defecation.
- Stool changes: diarrhea, constipation, or mixed.
- Extraintestinal: fatigue, dysmenorrhea, urinary symptoms.

## IBS subtypes

### IBS-D (Diarrhea predominant)
- Consider loperamide, rifaximin, or targeted 5-HT3 modulators.

### IBS-C (Constipation predominant)
- Consider PEG, tenapanor, or tegaserod.

### IBS-M (Mixed)
- Tailored management depending on predominant symptom.

### IBS-U (Unclassified)
- Criteria met but stool pattern not classifiable.

## Diagnosis

- Rome IV criteria (symptoms ≥6 months; recurrent abdominal pain ≥1 day/week for past 3 months; plus ≥2 of: relation to defecation, change in frequency or form).
- Labs: CBC for all; consider fecal calprotectin, CRP, celiac serology for diarrhea.
- Colonoscopy only with alarm features or routine CRC screening.
