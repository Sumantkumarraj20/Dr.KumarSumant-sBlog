# Acne Vulgaris – Patient Guide  

---

### 1️⃣ Understanding Acne
Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit.  
It usually appears on the **face, chest, back and shoulders**.  
Causes:
- Increased sebum production (often hormonal)
- Clogged pores (comedones)
- Bacterial overgrowth (*Cutibacterium acnes*)
- Inflammation

> Acne is **not** caused by dirt or poor hygiene.

### 2️⃣ What You Can Do at Home
- **Gentle cleansing** twice daily with a mild, fragrance-free cleanser  
- Use **non-comedogenic moisturiser** (gel or lotion)  
- Avoid picking or squeezing lesions  
- Use **broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF ≥30**  
- Balanced diet: limit very high-glycaemic foods, keep dairy moderate  
- Manage stress & sleep well

### 3️⃣ What a Doctor May Prescribe
| Severity | First-line | Comments |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Mild (comedones) | Topical retinoid (adapalene, tretinoin) | Start alternate nights |
| Mild–mod papules/pustules | Retinoid + benzoyl peroxide ± topical clindamycin | Use fixed-dose combos where possible |
| Moderate–severe / nodular | Oral doxycycline/minocycline + topical regimen | 3–6 months |
| Severe / scarring | Oral isotretinoin (with strict monitoring & contraception) | Only by dermatologist |

> **Not recommended:** routine multivitamins, PPIs, long-term steroids, unnecessary “detox” tests.

---

### 4️⃣ Treatment Expectations
- **6–8 weeks** for visible improvement  
- Maintenance often needed (topical retinoid)  
- Scars: may need separate procedures (peels, laser, microneedling) after active acne is controlled  
- Goal is **control, not “overnight cure.”**

---

### 5️⃣ When to Seek Help Quickly
- Sudden, very painful nodules with fever  
- Rapid scarring or dark marks  
- Severe dryness/lip cracks/vision changes while on isotretinoin  
- Mood changes while on oral therapy
